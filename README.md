See myself as a C++ software engineer.

Currently Iâ€™m studying on the C++ programming language mentoring program at company EPAM Systems, Inc to improve my
language and software development skills. At the university I used to learn this language, but didn't think to make it my main tool. I
used to learn Java, Ruby. Nowadays I think that C++ is interesting for its complexity and applicability in almost all spheres. I'd like to
work on interesting projects, with the focus on performance and new features, where I can really use the full power of the C++
language.

Relocation is possible.
