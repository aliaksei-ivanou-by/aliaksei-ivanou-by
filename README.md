See myself as a software engineer.

At the university I used to learn C++, but didn't think to make it my main tool. I used to learn Java, Ruby, MATLAB, LabVIEW.
Nowadays I think that C++ is interesting for its complexity and applicability in almost all spheres. I'd like to work on interesting
projects, with the focus on performance and new features, where I can really use the full power of the C++ language.

Languages: English B1+, Swedish A1 (in process).
