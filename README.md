See myself as a software engineer.

At the university I used to learn C++, but didn't think to make it my main tool. I used to learn Java, Ruby, MATLAB,
LabVIEW. Nowadays I think that C++ is interesting for its complexity and applicability in almost all spheres. I'd like to
work on interesting projects, with the focus on performance and new features, where I can really use the full power of the
C++ language.

English level: Speaking/Writing B1+/B2. Relocation is possible.
